# Welcome to React for Everyone!

## What is React?

React is a popular tool for building websites and apps. Think of it like digital Lego blocks that help create interactive web pages.

## Key Concepts

1. **Components**: These are like building blocks for your website
2. **Props**: A way to pass information between components
3. **State**: How React remembers and updates information

## Let's Build Something!

We'll create a simple greeting component:

\`\`\`jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
\`\`\`

This component says hello to anyone you want!

## Interactive Exercise: A Like Button

Let's create a button that counts likes:

\`\`\`jsx
function LikeButton() {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>This post has {likes} likes</p>
      <button onClick={() => setLikes(likes + 1)}>
        Like this!
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

Try making this button and see how many likes you can get!

## Fun Fact

Did you know? React was first used on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011!

Keep exploring and have fun with React!

# JavaScript Magic

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is like a magician's wand for websites. It can make web pages come alive with interactivity!

## Cool Things You Can Do

1. Make buttons do things when clicked
2. Create pop-up messages
3. Change colors and styles on the fly
4. Build games and animations

## Let's Try Some Magic!

Here's a spell to make a message appear:

\`\`\`javascript
function revealMessage() {
  alert("ðŸŽ‰ You've discovered the secret message! ðŸŽ‰");
}
\`\`\`

## Interactive Exercise: Color Changer

Let's create a button that changes colors:

\`\`\`javascript
function changeColor() {
  const colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'purple'];
  const randomColor = colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)];
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;
}
\`\`\`

Try making this color-changing button on your webpage!

## Fun Fact

JavaScript was created in just 10 days in 1995 by Brendan Eich!

Keep exploring and enjoy the magic of JavaScript!
